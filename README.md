This is very much a work in progress project. I want this website to be a place that has all my projects in one location so that I can put the url on my resume and it'll be easy for potential employers to navigate.

## Development Environment
I am using github to host my website, this is extreamly useful as it means that I wont have to pay for a domain. 

Ihave mostly used HTML and CSS, but I plan on using JavaScript in the site. I'm not too familiar with JS but that is one reason to have this be a continuing project.

## Future Work
- I want to add some JavaScript to make the website more appealing, for example, have a background that scrolls with the page, or a button that when clicked will do things to the page.
- I want to finish filling out the sub-pages of the site.
- I want to fix how it looks on a phone, the menu on the phone is way too big, the first headder section bleeds into the menu, ect.

## Development Environment
Same as before, I am using github to host my website, and I am using VS Code for my editor.

I've been trying to use some JavaScritp, but it has been proving to be somewhat dificult to understand. The styleing of the website has also taken more time than I would have liked, but I do like where it has gone.

## Future Work
- I still don't have the menu working on a couple of the sites how I want it to, I want to get the menu to work like it does on the mobile site.
- I want to learn more JS so I can make the website better, I still want to make a background that doesn't scroll with the page.
- I still need to work on some of the pages, I want to add more to the about me page, the contact info page, and the projects page.
