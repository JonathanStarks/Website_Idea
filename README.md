This is very much a work in progress project. I want this website to be a place that has all my projects in one location so that I can put the url on my resume and it'll be easy for potential employers to navigate.

## Development Environment
I am using github to host my website, this is extreamly useful as it means that I wont have to pay for a domain. 

Ihave mostly used HTML and CSS, but I plan on using JavaScript in the site. I'm not too familiar with JS but that is one reason to have this be a continuing project.

## Future Work
- I want to add some JavaScript to make the website more appealing, for example, have a background that scrolls with the page, or a button that when clicked will do things to the page.
- I want to finish filling out the sub-pages of the site.
- I want to fix how it looks on a phone, the menu on the phone is way too big, the first headder section bleeds into the menu, ect.
