            I wanted to make this website around the time that I thought about helping my grandparents update their buisness' website. I thought it might be a good thing to do if I wanted to help them redo it as my seinor project for college. The purpose of this website is to help me remember some things from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I also thought it might be cool if I could put a link to this website on my resume and have all of my projects on here, all in one easy to find and navigate place. The idea for the menu is the biggest giveaway for that. The <b><i>Home</i></b> button would take the user to this page, the <b><i>About Me</i></b> button would take the user to a page with some basic things about me, the <b><i>Projects</i></b> button would either take the user to my GitHub repositories or a page with links to my past projects, and the <b><i>Contact Info</i></b> button would provide information on how to connect to me.
